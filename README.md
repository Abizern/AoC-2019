# AoC-2019

Attempted Solutions for Advent of Code 2019

## Swift

Solutions for each day in a Playground, the inputs are embedded. Just run the playground page to see the results.

## Haskell

Solutions for each day in their own file. The output can be seen by:

### Directly run the file for the specific day:

```sh
runghc Day1.hs
```

### Compile to a binary and run it:

```sh
ghc Day1.hs && ./Day1
```

### Run the file through the REPL in your favourite editor
