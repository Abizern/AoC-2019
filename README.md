# AoC-2019

Attempted Solutions for Advent of Code 2019

Originally attempted these with Swift and Haskell, but now this is a single Swift package.

Managed 20/50 points which is a PB.

Got rid of the Haskell code and moved the package into the top level

Look at `main()` to see and amend what is output

From the root of the package run:

    swift run -c release
